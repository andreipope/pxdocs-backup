You can restore backups to the cluster you created it from, or to a new cluster. 

1. From the PX-Central home screen, select the PX-Backup icon on the left menu bar. The PX-Backup screen shows all of your backup operations divided into three categories: failed, in-progress, success.
2. Select the vertical menu icon from the successful backup you wish to restore, followed by the **Restore** option.
3. From the dialog box, specify the following:
    
    * **Name**: name your restore object. Youâ€™ll use this to identify the restore operation in the PX-Central UI.
    * **Destination cluster**: select the cluster you want to restore your backup to. This can be a different cluster from where the backup occurred.
    * **Default or Custom restore**: 
        * Under a default restore...
        * You can deselect source namespaces using the checkbox on the left. If you deselect a namespace, content from that namespace will not be restored. 
    * **Dest namespace**: specify a namespace on the target cluster you want to restore this backup to
    * **Replace existing resources**: replaces any matching existing resources with the content from this backup. Note that this does not replace any existing resources on other namespaces.
